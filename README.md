# tornado-saml

## SAML implementation in tornado web app using python-saml library. This project follows the demos from the python-saml repo which provides examples for bottle, flask, and django.

## WIP - The post data from the SP is not being handled correctly at the moment. The webapp is up and takes you to the OneLogin login portal, but once you input your creds, the server will crash.
